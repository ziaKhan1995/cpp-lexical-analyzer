# Lexical Analyzer Using C++

### This Lexical Analyzer 
 convert the input from a simple sequence of characters into a list of tokens of different kinds such as numerical and string constants, variable identifiers, and programming language keywords. The lexical analyzer identifies the error with the help of the automation machine and the grammar of the given language on which it is based like C, C++, and gives row numbers and column numbers of the error.
Following is the algorithm for the code:
ALGORITHM:
1.Tokenization i.e. Dividing the program into valid tokens.
2. Remove white space characters.
3. Remove comments.
4. It also provides help in generating error messages by providing row numbers and column numbers.
The code can be hence used, directly by running it on the machine.
